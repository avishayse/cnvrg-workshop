*Setting up DataSets*

before we start working on our model let upload our dataset in to cnvrg.

First lets pull the datasets from here:

[source,shell]
----
> wget http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz

> tar -xf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz

----

Before we want to upload our data we need to make sure we connect.

[source,shell]
----
> cnvrgv2 login

Seems you're already logged in

----

lets create a name for our dataset and associate a non empty folder with the new dataset.

[source,shell]
----
> cnvrgv2 dataset create -n aclImdb_test

> cnvrgv2 dataset put -n aclImdb

> Please enter a comma separated list of file paths to upload. use . to upload the whole directory: ./aclImdb
----
[source,shell]
