This Python script creates a dashboard using the Dash framework and displays a scatter plot of the gapminder dataset. 
The dashboard also contains a slider to filter the data based on the selected year.

Here is a breakdown of the script:

* The required packages are imported.
* A Flask server is created and a Dash app is initiated with the FLATLY bootstrap theme.
* The mapminder dataset is loaded from an external source.
* The layout of the dashboard is defined using the Bootstrap Grid system, containing a header with the title, and a `dcc.Graph` component for the scatter   plot and `dcc.Slider` component for the year selection.

* An `@app.callback` decorator is defined to update the scatter plot based on the selected year.
* The `update_figure` function filters the dataset based on the selected year and updates the scatter plot accordingly.
* The if `__name__ == '__main__'` block runs the app on the Flask server.
* This script can be used as a template to create interactive dashboards for various types of datasets.
