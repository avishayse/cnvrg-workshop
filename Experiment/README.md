**MNIST Convolutional Neural Network Example** <br>

This is an example of training a simple Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset using Keras. 
The model achieves a test accuracy of 99.25% after 12 epochs, but there is still room for parameter tuning.

**Requirements**<br>

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow

To train the model, run the following command: <br>

`python train.py --epochs 12 --batch_size 128`
