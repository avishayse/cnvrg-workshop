== Introduction

cnvrg.io delivers an AI OS built to actualize the AI-driven enterprise at scale. cnvrg.io is a compute-agnostic MLOps platform that offers a unified control plane to orchestrate all AI jobs and manage data science workflows at scale. Built by data scientists, for data scientists, cnvrg.io is the only solution that provides a code-first platform to manage, build and automate large-scale models in production.
With cnvrg you can Manage, Build And Automate The Entire AI/ML Lifecycle From Research To Production With One Unified Solution.

cnvrg.io classic AI and Metaclodu provide everything needed to build and deploy AI on any https://https://cnvrg.io/building-scalable-machine-learning-infrastructure/[Infrastructure]
	

provides a hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud unified fabric for scalable and secure AI development. The AI ready infrastructure delivers best practices architecture to IT teams with container-based workflows, native Kubernetes and easily blends into existing IT ecosystems. Optimized XPUs in partnerships with Intel, Optimized GPUs in partnerships with NVIDIA, Optimized Storage and Infrastructure in partnership with RedHat, Dell EMC, and NetApp.

== Getting started

- Letâ€™s begin by first logging into cnvrg. The lab assumes you already have access to a cnvrg environment and does not cover deployment. There is a video as well as documentation that can help you setup a cnvrg CORE deployment or sign up for a cloud account at https://cnvrg.io[Cnvrg.io]

- Once logged in go ahead and create the MNIST Example Project at the prpojects page. You can create a new project and call this project anything you want if you desire to follow along but choose your own dataset and challenge. Or you can choose to follow along with this lab example and we will explore the classic MNIST Dataset.

- Verify that your project was created and there are files in the File System.

- Now we can begin exploring the project.

== Projects

cnvrg simplifies ML workflows from end to end

For starters, a cnvrg project is the space in which you hold everything related to a specific machine learning problem or domain. You work and collaborate on projects.

A project can include files (code), *workspaces*, *experiments*, *flows*, *apps* and dashboards, *serving*, *artifacts*, *models* and even research interactive *papers*.

Create New Projects, Start from load yuor files into the platfrom and also creating new files, or import from github!

Read more about project in the docs https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/projects.html#creating-a-project[here]

== Datasets

- Verify that your project was created and there are files in the File System.

Here's how you say "`Hello, World!`" in Prawn:

.Create a basic PDF document using Prawn
[source,ruby]
----
require 'prawn'

Prawn::Document.generate 'example.pdf' do
  text 'Hello, World!'
end
----

== Conclusion

That's all, folks!
