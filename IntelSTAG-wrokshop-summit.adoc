cnvrg.io delivers an AI OS built to actualize the AI-driven enterprise at scale. cnvrg.io is a compute-agnostic MLOps platform that offers a unified control plane to orchestrate all AI jobs and manage data science workflows at scale. Built by data scientists, for data scientists, cnvrg.io is the only solution that provides a code-first platform to manage, build and automate large-scale models in production.
With cnvrg you can Manage, Build And Automate The Entire AI/ML Lifecycle From Research To Production With One Unified Solution.

cnvrg.io classic AI and Metaclod provide everything needed to build and deploy AI on any https://https://cnvrg.io/building-scalable-machine-learning-infrastructure/[Infrastructure]
	

provides a hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud unified fabric for scalable and secure AI development. The AI ready infrastructure delivers best practices architecture to IT teams with container-based workflows, native Kubernetes and easily blends into existing IT ecosystems. Optimized XPUs in partnerships with Intel, Optimized GPUs in partnerships with NVIDIA, Optimized Storage and Infrastructure in partnership with RedHat, Dell EMC, and NetApp.

== Datasets

Usually, we would import a dataset before beginning to work on the Project. However, in this case, we will be using Keras to download the dataset within the project.

== Projects

cnvrg simplifies ML workflows from end to end

For starters, a cnvrg project is the space in which you hold everything related to a specific machine learning problem or domain. You work and collaborate on projects. A project can include files (code), https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/workspaces.html[workspaces], https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/experiments.html[experiments], https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/flows.html[flows],  https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/apps.html[apps] and https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/dashboard.html#summary[dashboard],  https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/endpoints.html[serving], *artifacts*, *models* and even research interactive *papers*.

== Getting the project started

On the website, navigate to the Projects tab

Welcome to the home of your code, experiments, flows and deployments. Here everything lives and works together.

- For this example, we’ll use the prebuilt example project. 
  . On the top right, click *Example Projects*.
  . Select *Text Classification with Keras and IMDB dataset.*

- Now you’ve created a cnvrg project titled imdb. The imdb project dashboard is displayed. Let’s have a closer look at what’s inside the project and files.

== Launching a Jupyter Workspace

cnvrg.io has built-in support for JupyterLab, JupterLab on Spark, R Studio and Visual Studio Code to run on the platfrom. as well the ability to run code on your local IDE using the https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/python_sdk_v2.html[cnvrgv2-SDK] library.

A cnvrg workspace is an interactive environment for developing and running code.


Create your first workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Go ahead and launch your first workspace, click *“Start a Workspace”*
  . Enter *title* name
  . select your preferable *compute template* we go with 1cpu and 2G
  . Select the relenat *dataset* "lending-club"
  . select relevant *image*, cnvrg provide out of the box images, in this case *cnvrgv5* image.
  . hit the *start* button

This is how it looks:

You can explore the files and even start editing and modifying them if you wish at this point.

== Experiments

Experiments are the core of every machine learning project. When building a model, it’s all about trying new ideas, testing new hypotheses, testing hyperparameters, and exploring different neural-network architecture.

To run an experiment via the web, go to your project, click the Experiments tab and click New Experiment.

cnvrg allows you to run experiments.
An experiment can be any executable, written in any language: Python, R, Java, Scala and more. It can also be an existing Jupyter notebook.

Running an experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- On your project’s sidebar, click Experiments, then click New Experiment. In the panel that appears:
  . For *Command to Execute*, type in or select python3 train.py.
  . For *Environment* > *Compute*, select large.
  . Click *Run*.
