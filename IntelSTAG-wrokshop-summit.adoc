== Introduction

cnvrg.io delivers an AI OS built to actualize the AI-driven enterprise at scale. cnvrg.io is a compute-agnostic MLOps platform that offers a unified control plane to orchestrate all AI jobs and manage data science workflows at scale. Built by data scientists, for data scientists, cnvrg.io is the only solution that provides a code-first platform to manage, build and automate large-scale models in production.
With cnvrg you can Manage, Build And Automate The Entire AI/ML Lifecycle From Research To Production With One Unified Solution.

cnvrg.io classic AI and Metaclodu provide everything needed to build and deploy AI on any https://https://cnvrg.io/building-scalable-machine-learning-infrastructure/[Infrastructure]
	

provides a hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud unified fabric for scalable and secure AI development. The AI ready infrastructure delivers best practices architecture to IT teams with container-based workflows, native Kubernetes and easily blends into existing IT ecosystems. Optimized XPUs in partnerships with Intel, Optimized GPUs in partnerships with NVIDIA, Optimized Storage and Infrastructure in partnership with RedHat, Dell EMC, and NetApp.

== Getting started

- Let’s begin by first logging into cnvrg. The lab assumes you already have access to a cnvrg environment and does not cover deployment. There is a video as well as documentation that can help you setup a cnvrg CORE deployment or sign up for a cloud account at https://cnvrg.io[Cnvrg.io]

- Once logged in go ahead and create the, ML Pipeline with the LendingClub dataset Example Project at the prpojects page. You can create a new project and call this project anything you want if you desire to follow along but choose your own dataset.

- Verify that your project was created and there are files in the File System.

- Now we can begin exploring the project.

== Projects

cnvrg simplifies ML workflows from end to end

For starters, a cnvrg project is the space in which you hold everything related to a specific machine learning problem or domain. You work and collaborate on projects.

A project can include files (code), https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/workspaces.html[workspaces], https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/experiments.html[experiments], https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/flows.html[flows],  https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/apps.html[apps] and https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/dashboard.html#summary[dashboard],  https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/endpoints.html[serving], *artifacts*, *models* and even research interactive *papers*.

Create New Projects, Start from load yuor files into the platfrom and also creating new files, or import from github!

Read more about project in the docs https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/projects.html#creating-a-project[here]

== Files

cnvrg has inline support for rendering a viewing multiple file types

cnvrg offers out-of-the-box version control for your project. With the simple drag-and-drop interface or the  https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/python_sdk_v2.html[cnvrgv2] CLI, you can have your project files (code, artifacts) automatically tracked and versioned.

cnvrg will automatically create new commits for experiments and workspaces syncs and keep track of all your projects' files. When connected to git, only the designated *output* folder will be synced and managed by cnvrg.

== Workspaces

cnvrg.io has built-in support for JupyterLab, JupterLab on Spark, R Studio and Visual Studio Code to run on the platfrom. as well the ability to run code on your local IDE using the https://app.cnvrg.io/docs/core_concepts/python_sdk_v2.html[cnvrgv2-SDK] library.

A cnvrg workspace is an interactive environment for developing and running code.

Create your first workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Next go ahead and launch your first workspace, click *“Start a Workspace”*
  . Enter *title* name
  . select your preferable *compute template* we go with 1cpu and 2G
  . Select the relenat *dataset* "lending-club"
  . select relevant *image*, cnvrg provide out of the box images, in this case *cnvrgv5* image.
  . hit the *start* button

You can explore the files and even start editing and modifying them if you wish at this point.

== Datasets

- Verify that your project was created and there are files in the File System.

Here's how you say "`Hello, World!`" in Prawn:

.Create a basic PDF document using Prawn
[source,ruby]
----
require 'prawn'

Prawn::Document.generate 'example.pdf' do
  text 'Hello, World!'
end
----

== Conclusion

That's all, folks!
